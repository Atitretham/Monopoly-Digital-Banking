# Monopoly Digital Banking
---
### What is it?
Monopoly Digital Banking, or MDP, is meant to be a digital way of handling cash in Monopoly.
It will give each user a PIN for authenticating transactions, so two players cant steel another
players money during an unrelated transaction.

### How do you use it?
1. Launch the applacation.
2. Set a bankers PIN. This will be used to authenticate all transactions envolving the bank.
3. Enter how many players there are
4. Enter information for each player. Each player must enter their own PIN and keep it a secret from everyone, including the banker.
5. Your all setup, you can start the game. All players have allready been given the starting amount of money.
